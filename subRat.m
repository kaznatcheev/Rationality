%       [i, 4] is the number of defections seen when the ith agent defected
%   game - 2 x 2 matrix that represents the game (payoff matrix)
%   w  - selection strength
%   updateRule - a function (adjmx, genotypes, w, fitness, pmod, reproduce --> genotypes, minds) that
%     specifies how agents are modified
%   max_epoch - number of iterations of the simulation
%   pmod - percent modified in the update rule

%       [t, 3] is the number of mutual defections
%       [t, 4] is average U
